Hello!

I'm a rising junior studying Computer Science who has always loved the scalability of tech solutions to challenging problems. I’m also Vice-President of the Association for Computing Machinery at my university for this reason. 

In addition to holding a worthwhile leadership position on campus, I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks for side projects. I’m currently building most frequently with JavaScript and learning the React framework.

Post-graduation in May 2024, I am hoping to have the opportunity to work within the tech industry and contribute to the betterment of the world with my area of expertise.
